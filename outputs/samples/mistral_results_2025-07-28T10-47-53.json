        "story": "It is said that the first thing that a newly born puppy does after his eyes are opened is to look for his mother. The second thing that he does is to look for a bone. And the third thing is to find it! This little dog, Pippin, was a week old when he did all three things. His mother was a black and tan collie bitch, and his father was a big black Newfoundland dog. Both were very fond of him, and used to bring him their bones to chew. One day his mother went out into the yard to get some fresh air, and left Pippin curled up near the fire. She had been gone so long that at last he began to whine and whimper. Then he thought he heard her coming, and wagged his tail and raised his head to look at the door. But no, it was not she; it was something else creeping slowly along the floor. Pippin saw it plainly enough. It was a rat, and he knew it for what it was. He had never seen one before, but he had heard his mother talk about them. She called them terrible names, and said they were enemies to all clean animals, and ought to be killed whenever they were found. So Pippin knew at once what kind of a creature it was, and he wished very much that he could catch it. But how could he? It was too quick for him. However, he would try. He put out one paw, and then another, and began to creep after it. The rat stopped and looked at him. Oh, how funny it must have looked to see that fat little puppy trying to catch such a thin, long-tailed fellow! But Pippin was very anxious to show that he could do as well as any grown dog, and he followed the rat around and around the room until it ran under the bed. There it hid itself, and Pippin could not reach it. But he did not give up. He lay down on the rug and waited. After a while the rat came out again, and Pippin sprang at it. They rolled over and over together, and at last the rat slipped away. But Pippin caught hold of its long tail, and pulled and pulled till he drew it out from under the bed. Then he gave three or four sharp bites, and the rat let go of the bone, and Pippin picked it up.",

        "story": "THE BUTTERFLY AND THE BULLY The Butterfly sat on the tallest thistle in the meadow. She was all dressed in black, and her wings were dotted all over with little white spots. When the Moth saw her he came to her and said, \"Good day, beautiful lady. I have come to ask you why your wings are so differently colored from mine.\" \"I am sorry,\" she answered, \"but it is not at all because I am more beautiful than you. It is simply that I am younger than you are. You see, when I was born my wings were as white as yours. But every day I have grown older and older, and every day I have been more and more curious about the world, and have wanted to fly about and see everything. So I thought if I went and visited all the pretty flowers in the meadow, they would give me something to remember them by; and whenever I visit any flower, it always gives me a little gift. So I asked the Violet for a sprinkle of blue paint with which to dot my wings, and the Forget-me-not gave me some forget-me-not-blue. Then I went to the Clover and begged him for a few grains of clover-color, and he gave me some lovely yellow. Afterwards I asked the Daisy for a dusting of white paint, and she let me have it all over my wings. And now, do you think I am not much prettier than you are?\" \"Oh, yes indeed,\" cried the Moth; \"but then, after all, you are such a silly little creature, and so am I. We must both fly about and get ourselves killed as soon as we can.\" Just then the Bull came rushing into the meadow, and the Moth flew up to him at once and said, \"How do you do, Bull? I hope you are well.\" \"Oh, yes, thank you,\" replied the Bull; \"and how do you do?\" \"Very well, thank you,\" answered the Moth. \"But tell me, have you ever seen a Butterfly?\" \"Yes, indeed,\" said the Bull, \"I have seen many, and I have eaten them, too.\" \"Ah! well,\" said the Moth, \"that's just what I was coming to ask you. Will you promise not to eat me if I happen to fly near you?\" \"No",

Afterwards I returned homeward to my lodging, where I found Pantagruel and Friar John asleep; but Friar Johns farting was so loud and sharp that it almost made me run away. When they were waked, we dined together at a tavern, and in the afternoon we went towards the town hall, to see how the judges would deal with our lawsuit; but there we heard no more than that they had not yet finished their perusal of the writ, and were to give us notice. From thence we walked into the convent of the Carmelites, who were then keeping their feast of St. Simon Stock; and there we supped right well, having been invited by one of them, who came from the country of Angoumois, near to Montpensier. After supper we returned thither, and, having taken a little rest, we went out again at night, and went about town. Then we saw the street filled with people, who were running hither and thither, and crying out, The devil is loose! The devil is loose! Hark! Hark! They are beating the drums! We do not know what all this noise means, said I. Let us go to the Devils shop, answered Pantagruel, and see if we can discover anything there. So we went thither, and there we found a great crowd of people collected together, which made us suspect that something extraordinary must have happened. It seemed as if the devils had lost their liberty, or that some of them were got loose out of the shop; therefore we stayed there to see what would befall, thinking that the devils would soon come forth out of the shop and make a rush upon us, like swarms of flies; but they never stirred. The people asked us why we stood there, and told us that nothing was to be seen. I dont believe it, said I, we shall see something presently. You are mistaken, replied one of them; you should have been here yesterday. Pray, tell us what was done yesterday, quoth Pantagruel; I did not happen to be here then. Yesterday, said he, the devil made his appearance in the shop, and ran about amongst the people, frightening them right terribly. He had",

HOW THE WHOLE THING BEGAN It is only about six weeks since it all began, but it seems as if it had been years. In the very first chapter you will be surprised to learn that the person who was the cause of it all, and who did begin it, was a little girl named Mary Lennox. She was not a nice little girl, nor was she ever told so, at any rate, by her own parents. They thought she was a nice little girl, because she looked nice. She was small, and neat, and smart, and wore pretty dresses; but she was not nice. Her face was round and plump and pink, and she had a ripple of golden hair down her back. She looked like a good little girl, in fact, just as some dolls look like good girls. But dolls are not always good, and Mary Littleton Lennox was not a good little girl. She was obstinate and willful, and she flew into rages of anger which scared everybody. When she was told to do anything she always said no. If she wanted anything and did not get it she cried and screamed until she made her parents' heads ache. She was not grateful or generous. She never played with other children unless they were told to play with her, and then she made them do everything she wanted them to do. At night when",

        "story": "The Maidens Dance When the morning came, I was awakened by the voice of Penrod, who stood at the foot of my bed, saying in his most engaging manner: Well, Scharlo, are you up? I was up, but it was only because I had been up all night. The dream had left me wide awake, and after looking at Penrods face for a while, I had sat up and thought out a plan to put an end to the whole business. At first, I considered going into Penrods room and telling him that if he ever again interrupted my sleep by coming into my room in the middle of the night to talk about his stupid dog, I would kill him; but I reflected that this course might lead to a struggle, during which I should probably lose my temper so completely that I should box his ears, and I knew very well that if I did, Mother would hear of it, and there would be no peace in our household until she forgave me; so I abandoned that idea. Instead, I determined to go into Penrods room in the morning and tell him that if he ever again disturbed me, I would move away and never speak to him again. But when I saw him standing at my bedside in the morning, I did not feel quite as confident as I had the night before. After all, Penrod was such a nice boy, and I didnt want to make him mad. However, I made up my mind that I would carry out my plan, whatever happened. So I got up, dressed, and went into his room. He looked surprised, and said: Why, good-morning, Scharlo! Did you have a nice time sleeping? I pretended to be annoyed. What do you mean, Did I have a nice time sleeping? It was almost midnight when you came in here and woke me up. Dont you remember? Oh, yes, said Penrod, looking guilty; but I thought you were asleep. Of course I was asleep! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, creeping into my room like that! Well, said Penrod, looking still guiltier, I thought you were asleep. Ive been trying to get some more dreams for Dr. Peabody, but I couldnt find any. Can you give me one now? Not for anything in the world! I told him. And then, feeling that I was carrying out my purpose with becoming firmness, I",

        "story": "The next day the news of our victory had spread over all Suffolk, and in the afternoon we went up to Ipswich to hear what they would say about us there. As soon as we got to the town we were surrounded by a mob of people; and the moment we stepped into a public-house they began to ply us with beer and to ask questions about our wonderful success at Diss. When we told them that we had beaten the famous Etonians at cricket, and had scored 147 runs without losing a wicket, they were as much astonished as if we had performed some miraculous feat. One man said that he never believed any schoolboys could play so well, but another said that he had seen the Eton boys play once, and thought they were very fine cricketers indeed. However, when we explained how we had managed to keep them out, and how often we had made them lose wickets, they all agreed that we must be quite as good as ourselves, and that the game had been quite evenly contested. After staying an hour or two at the Crown Inn we returned home by the same road, and met a great many people going the other way--all of whom were full of praise for us. The best of it was that everybody spoke of us as a _team_, and never mentioned one boy above another; but always spoke of us as a body, and praised our united efforts to conquer our enemies. This was very gratifying to me, and gave me a high opinion of my own powers of leadership, which was not at all exaggerated, as events proved. That night I dreamt that I was playing cricket against the Devil, who bowled to me with such skill and cunning that I could hardly hit his balls; but every time I missed him he laughed and said, \"I am sorry for you, little boy, you will never beat me.\" However, I kept on hitting hard, though I seldom hit far, and at last he said, \"Well, I think I have had enough of this; I'll let you win, only promise that you won't tell anybody.\" So I promised, and then he took me in his arms and carried me over the river Stour to a dark place, where there were no houses, and put me down. Then he came to me and said, \"You are a wise boy; if you ever tell anybody I shall come and get you,\" and went",

So I ran down-stairs and took him up in my arms, and carried him to the fireplace; and there we stood, father and son, looking into the flames together. And now, cried the old man, as he wiped his eyes with his great red handkerchief, I have told you all. The young man looked at him kindly, and thanked him for his confidence. There was no mystery in the matter, he said, but only a little misunderstanding; and the end of it all was that the old man had a grandson. Now let us talk of something else, he added. But, cried the old man, eagerly, do you mean to say that it is true? Have I really a grandchild? Yes, indeed, replied the young man, laughing. Why, yes; and he looks very much like you. He has your nose, your mouth, your chin--everything, except his hair. That is quite black, and quite curly, too. As he spoke he drew out his watch and opened it. Look at the photograph, said he. The old man took the watch and looked at it. Ah! cried he, here is my boy! Here is my darling boy! And he kissed the glass again and again, and handled the watch as though he could not believe his eyes. Then, turning to the young man, What shall I do now? he asked. Shall I go home to-morrow? No, no, cried the young man, do not go away yet. Stay with me for a few days, and then we will see. I will take care of you while you are here. You may sleep in my room, and I will get you another bedstead. So they went upstairs together, and the old man laid himself down upon the sofa, and the young man put some straw under his head and covered him up with a blanket. Then he went to his own room, and took off his coat and waistcoat, and lay down beside the old man on the sofa, and put his arm round him, and they both fell asleep. When the old man woke up in the morning, there was the young man lying beside him, sound asleep, with his arm round him. Ah! cried the old man, what a pleasant dream that was! It seemed to me that I was a young man again, and",

        "story": "The discovery of the canal system, in conjunction with other facts, forced me to accept the existence of some form of intelligent life upon the planet. I had been wondering how it was that such a network could have been constructed without the use of vehicles, but then I remembered that of course they would not travel by vehicle. The canals are dug with pick and shovel; and when once dug, the water is carried in great concrete-lined troughs, which lie beside the canals at right angles to them. It did not require much imagination to picture these people working along the banks of the canals, carrying the water from the river to the fields. But what about irrigation? How do they get the water to their crops? This question was answered during my first day's wanderings among the ruins. In one of the larger public squares of the city I came upon a large circular structure, and as I approached I saw that it was a reservoir, similar to those used in our own country. A number of small aqueducts emptied into it, bringing the water from the surrounding canals, and from one of these aqueducts a number of small pipes led away, each pipe being fitted with a valve which could be opened or closed at will. As I stood watching the scene, I noticed that several of the inhabitants were coming up to the pumps and drawing water from them with buckets, which they carried away in baskets suspended from poles across their backs. Nearby were a number of oxen standing in stalls, and as I looked more closely I saw that they were harnessed, and that the harnesses were fitted with gear wheels, the purpose of which I could not at first understand. Presently, however, it became apparent. When the bucket was raised to the top of the pump, it was caught in a series of teeth around the rim of the wheel, and as the animal pulled at the shaft, the wheel turned, emptying the bucket and raising it automatically to the top again, ready for the next load. I found that this was the regular method of irrigation employed by the Martians, and as I went from one part of the city to another, I saw many examples of the same thing. Sometimes the animals were replaced by men who worked in relays, pulling at ropes attached to the shaft, while others drew the buckets up by hand. At noon I took a short rest in",
